the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make

The primary source of this data used here is data Palmora Group emp_data.csv.

### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we perform the following actions;
a. Data loading and inspection
    b. Handling missing variables
    c. Data cleaning and formatting
    
## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
EDA involves the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as:
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and 
departments 
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender 
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If 
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of 
management 
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay 
employees a minimum of $90,000 
● Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
● Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
● How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, 
etc.? 
● Also visualize this by regions 
 

## DATA ANALYSIS
This is where we include some basic lines of codes or queries or even some of the DAX 
expressions used during the analysis.

        Employee count = COUNTROWS('Employee')
